# 3D Checkers Prototype
A 3D Checkers prototype developed in 48 hours with some basic rules implemented and camera movement.<br>
You can check out the source code to see how i've implemented the Turn System and all the other mechanics that are in the game aswell.<br>
The game is published on Itch.io and for now it's state is on hold as i got other projects to work on, but it is playable directly on the browser if you go to the Itch.io page, or you can also download it and extract.
